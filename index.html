<h1>Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?</h1>

<p>Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"</p>

<p>Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."</p>

<p>But, if pressed, how would you prove it?</p>

<p>In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
</p>

<p>The first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
  <li>Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
  <li>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
  <li>Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>
</ul>
